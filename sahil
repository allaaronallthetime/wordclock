Alright, so I want HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAME (three separate groups of LEDs, defined by lines 142 and 143) to rapidly cycle through colours - a moving rainbow. I think the way to go is with the fill_rainbow() function in the FastLED library, but I had some trouble making it work. 

documentation for the fill_rainbow is at http://fastled.io/docs/3.1/group___colorutils.html#details


Lines 293 and 296 currently just light up the HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAME, but in the same colour as the rest of the text, so that looks shit.

It should come on at (hour==6), so it doesn't tick over to midnight and blast out colour while in night mode (see below).



The two time buttons (btnHour, btnMin) should increment the hour by 1 and the minutes by 5 (rounded to the nearest five).

Additionally, I want to add two functions to the third button (btnColour):

1. When you press it quickly (if time<=1000 ?), it toggles between a night mode (colour of all leds goes to ::Red and the brightness is dropped). It should also kill the Happy Birthday rainbow if that's happening. 

2. When you hold it (if time>1000 ?) it gradually cycles through colours (presumably instead of CRGB you use CHSV and just ++ the H value) so you can pick the colour you want for your clock.


So like any thoughts or ideas or code I'd be incredibly grateful for. I'll be home in about 4.5 - I'll hit you up then. Also be working most of tomorrow on it.

THANKS BROSTOEVSKI
